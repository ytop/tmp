class SampledSoftmaxLoss(_Loss):
    r"""
    Computes the sampled softmax training loss.

    Args:
        num_sampled (int): The number of classes to randomly sample per batch.
        num_classes (int): The number of possible classes.
        num_true (int): The number of target classes per training example.
        sampled_values (Tuple):  Tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`,
            `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function.
            (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)
        remove_accidental_hits (bool): Whether to remove "accidental hits"
            where a sampled class equals one of the target classes.  Default is True.
        seed (int): Random seed for candidate sampling. Default to None, which doesn't set
            the op-level random seed for candidate sampling.

    Inputs:
        - **weights** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (C, dim).
        - **bias** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (C).  The class biases.
        - **labels** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (N, num_true), type `int64`. The
            target classes.
        - **inputs** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (N, dim).  The forward activations of
            the input network.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, a tensor of the same shape as logits with the component-wise
        logistic losses.
        (A `batch_size` 1-D tensor of per-example sampled softmax losses.)
